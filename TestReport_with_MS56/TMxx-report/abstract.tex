This report aims to provide a general review on the performance of the gravity model used on the PR37 surgical 7DOF arm MS7. The gravity model outputs joint torques (nominal) of all the arm actuators, and these values will be compared with joint torque sensors (experimental) to evaluate the gravity model. Assuming that torque sensor reading is reliable, the difference between nominal and experimental joint torques should be below a certain threshold. This report will present this threshold for each joint with experiments on pre-defined robot configurations. 

The tests in this report are designed for a MS7 robot set, which includes the 7DOF arm and IDM, no extra load. 

Robot configuration plays an important role in the gravity model. The pre-defined robot configurations can be divided in two groups. The first group includes robot configurations provided by Auris for different use cases. The second group includes robot configurations that maximize the load a certain joint. Therefore, the pre-defined robot configurations cover the general cases as well as the extreme cases.
